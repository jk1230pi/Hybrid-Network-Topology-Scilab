# Hybrid-Network-Topology-Scilab

This repository contains Scilab code for designing and visualizing a Hybrid
Network Topology created using Star, Ring, and Bus topologies. The project
includes node and edge numbering, color-coded visualization, and basic
network analysis such as degree calculation and total node and edge count.
